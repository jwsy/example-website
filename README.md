This is a tutorial on what to do once you've finished building a website in the fantastic <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website" target="_blank">Codecademy tutorials</a> and want to make your own web pages and limited apps. This tutorial specifically describes how to set up a website hosted by GitHub using the Github Desktop GUI in OSX.

### Prerequisites
* Register for and setup a GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a>
* Install the <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom text editor</a>
* Install <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>, "_a seamless way to contribute to projects on GitHub and GitHub Enterprise._"

### Overview
We'll start by setting up a your "development environment" and then creating and contributing to a repository in GitHub. Ultimately, we'll finish with a page hosted on the internet that you can access from anywhere.

## Initial Setup

1. Install the <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom text editor</a>

1. Get an account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">https://github.com</a>. Once you've created your account, create a new repository by clicking the '+' sign next to your profile pic in the upper right.

1.  Create a repository, in this example I create one named _example-website_. Make it _Public_ and use the defaults.

  <img src="images/create-repo.png" width="600">

1. Once the repository is created, install and configure GitHub Desktop. Configuration requires you to sign in with your Github account credentials that you created earlier.

  <img src="images/ghd-setup.png" width="500">

1. In GitHub Desktop, click the '+' in the upper left and clone the repo you just created.

  <img src="images/clone-repo.png" width="600">

Congratulations, you're ready to start building your webpage! :smile:

### Create your local webpage

1. Once you've cloned the repo to your computer, let's build a local webpage stored on your computer. Click the branch button and create a new branch named _gh-pages_ -- this name is important and more detail about this can be found in the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/).

  <img src="images/create-gh-pages.png" width="500">

1. In GitHub Desktop, edit your repo in your text editor Atom by right-clicking the repo and selecting Open in Atom. Be sure that the repo you're working on is gh-pages as shown in the upper-right of the below image.

  <img src="images/open-atom.png" width="300">

  You should see Atom like this, and note the location in the window title. The location should look like _/Users/<username>/GitHub/example-website_

  <img src="images/atom-opened.png" width="500">

1. In Atom, create an index.html file by right-clicking the repo name and selecting _New File_, and name the file _index.html_.

  <img src="images/new-file.png" width="300">

  <img src="images/create-index-html.png" width="700">

1. Add in your basic HTML to _index.html_. This should feel just like the Codecademy coding "IDE" (Interactive Development Environment) except now you're out of a browser and creating an actual file on your computer. You can copy the one I used in the example from [here](https://github.com/jwsy/example-website/blob/99509e2b6c1adc8bb959b2cf239a2a3047a7a493/index.html):

  <img src="images/index-html.png" width="600">

  Keen eyed readers will notice that I missed the closing '>' in my title tag. It doesn't change anything in the tutorial, but good eye :+1:

1. You can view this actual file on your computer by right-clicking the _index.html_ file and selecting "Show in Finder"

  <img src="images/show-in-finder.png" width="200">

  <img src="images/in-finder.png" width="500">

  Double-clicking the _index.html_ file should open it up in a web browser where you can see your code rendered like it would be if you were to host it on the internet.

  <img src="images/browser-local1.png" width="500">

  Try making more changes to _index.html_ and refreshing your browser.

### Host your page in GitHub Pages

1. Now that you've got a working page in your repo, make a commit and push it to GitHub where it will be hosted. To do this, go back to GitHub Desktop, enter a commit message like "Create index.html" and click the _Commit to gh-pages_ button -- it's important to make sure you're committing to _gh-pages_. Then click the _Sync_ button in the upper right to copy your repo to GitHub Pages.

  <img src="images/first-commit.png" width="600">

1. Visit your project site at https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/example-website. If you change the branch from _master_ to _gh-pages_, you should see the files you've committed.

  <img src="images/switch-branch.png" width="300">

  <img src="images/hosted1.png" width="600">

1. Finally, view your page at http://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/example-website (mine is [http://jwsy.github.io/example-website](http://jwsy.github.io/example-website)) -- congratulations! :smile:

  <img src="images/hosted-ghp.png" width="600">

### Update your website

1. Go back to Atom and add a _css_ folder for CSS and a _style.css_ stylesheet for your page.

  To add the folder, right-click below the files in the left pane.

  <img src="images/new-folder.png" width="300">

  <img src="images/css-folder.png" width="500">

1. Right-click the new _css_ folder and create a _style.css_ file.

  <img src="images/style-file-add.png" width="500">

1. Edit _style.css_ to add some color to the page, just like how you did in Codecademy. See my papayawhip example [here](https://github.com/jwsy/example-website/blob/master/css/style.css).

  <img src="images/style-edit.png" width="600">

1. Edit _index.html_ and add a link to the stylesheet you just added. In this example, I add:

  ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">
  ```

  <img src="images/add-link-to-index.png" width="600">

1. View your local website the same way you did before by selecting _Show in Finder_ and opening the file in your browser. Mine looked like this, and note the URL that starts with "file:///"

  <img src="images/local2.png" width="600">

1. Go back to GitHub Desktop and take a look at how it's tracked    your changes. You should see your stylesheet and HTML as the two changes.

  Like before, add a commit message, click the _Commit to gh-pages_ button, and click the _Sync_ button.

  If you want to make more changes, follow the same workflow of editing locally, committing, and syncing.

  <img src="images/last-commit.png" width="600">

1. Go to your project site on GitHub, visit the gh-pages branch, and make sure that your new CSS folder and updated index page are there.

  <img src="images/gh-after-commit.png" width="600">

  And finally, visit your updated page with your updated code.

Congratulations: you've made your own simple website and hosted it in GitHub Pages using the skills you've learned at Codecademy! :smile:
